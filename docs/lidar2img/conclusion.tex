We have presented the algorithm that aligns oribital LIDAR data to image data
in the presence of substantial position errors implemented by the {\texttt{lidar2img}} program.
The algorithm applies Gauss-Newton
on an image pyramid to avoid local minima. We have demonstrated the algorithm's
success on lunar data, and successfully coregistered LIDAR and image data of the moon.
